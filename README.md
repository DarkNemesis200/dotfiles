# Welcome to my dotfiles and scripts

This is a collection of my dotfiles and the scripts I have for making my rice easier to use and more efficient. I have made scripts that enable a small pop-up menu to show up allowing the choice between a few options for each button press as well as a default i.e. super + w launches surf in tabbed while super + shift + w brings up a web browser menu.

I've also put some alias' into my .zshrc file so I don't need to type sudo as often for certain commands.


The programs I use in my dotfiles are:
* termite - for my terminal
* ranger - for my in-terminal file browser
* comnpton - to reduce screen-tearing and add transparency
* rofi - for my application launcher and for choosing options within some of my scripts
* dmenu - in addition to rofi to extend its use and for use with the surf browser
* vim, atom, vs-code, arduino - I use a mixture of these for my programming generally depending on the project I'm working on
* LaTeX - for uni note taking and general writing
* vim-live-latex-preview + zathura - for viewing my LaTeX files
* zsh, oh-my-zsh, zsh-syntax-highlighting - preferred over bash and to make my terminal a little nicer
* feh - to set my wallpaper
* i3-Gaps - wm
* polybar - status bar
* polybar spotify plugin - to add spotify support
* w3m - to add images to ranger
* numlockx - auto set numlock on
* udiskie - auto mount usb devices (symbolically linked to a better folder)
* dunst - notifications
* htop - task manager
* neofetch
* cava - music visualiser
* scrot - screenshotting
* tabbed + surf - most web browsing
* Gohu GohuFont - main font
* EmojiOne - emoji fonts
* tmux - terminal multiplexing
* pamixer and pulseaudio - audio
* playerctl to enable media keys on keyboard
* xdotool - needed for some scripts
* cmatrix
